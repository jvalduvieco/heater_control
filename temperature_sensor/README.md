# Temperature sensorÂ 

* Power using Vcc at 5V. If powering directly to 3.3v input board burns on connecting a USB cable.
* Does not allow OTA due insufficient memory. Need to investigate.
* Add board: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
* Board ESP32 Arduino -> ESP32 dev module
* Temperature sensor DS18B20
